# ffxi-client-utils

Ron's FFXI client utilities, which includes Windower4 macro scripts and Gearswap addon scripts. Free for use. These are optimized/intended for use on the Supernova Private Server.

## gearswap_scripts

Files intended to go in `Windower\addons\GearSwap\data` of your Windower install location. If you want to reuse the files here you must change the filename to your character name. A good place to start if you want to read a single file and get an understanding for things to write your own is `BASE_STARTER.lua`.

## macro_scripts

Files intended to go in `Windower\scripts` and loaded as macros in game with a command like:
* `/console exec Script.txt`
* `/console exec BLM/SoloMini.txt`
